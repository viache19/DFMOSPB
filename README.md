Designs For Make Open Sources Projects Better

Hi all, in first say that my English is not soo good since I am trying to write without the Google Translate) I will try to explain it in the best way I can.

Behind all big products are big problems, in the universe of the OpenSource Projects we have an enourmous problem, the money $$€€. So why do not resolve it, making an OpenSource Project =)?

The principal idea of DFMOSPB (Designs For Make Open Sources Projects Bettter), a start project with very poor fantasy name, is to think how we can earn money to help OpenSources Projects,
  - The Foundament of this project is to use designs of the logos of the projects to open a clothe shop using diferents programs, like a Amazon Merch, o something like this.
  
What we need from you?
  - You designs are welcome)
  - If you share this mini project with another people is welcome too))
